# prompt-builder

I want you to help me build Prompt builder where I can drag and drop and create different components to create my own system prompts.

This should specifically to create a system prompt that helps me generate a cold outreach message on LinkedIn.

The user should be able to create "hard-coded"-text blocks, but also AI-generated personalized sentences, combining these components to building the specific message to the persona (data will be inputted as variables about the persona such that each message is personalized)
